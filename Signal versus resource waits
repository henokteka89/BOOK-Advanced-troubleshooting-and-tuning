-- shows you how to compare cumulative signal and resource waits in the system.
/*
In most cases, signal waits should not exceed 10 to 15% of total wait time.
A higher number may indicate a CPU bottleneck, with tasks spending a lot
of time in the RUNNABLE queue. Do not jump to the conclusion that you
need to add more CPUs, thoughâ€”it may be entirely possible to address the
problem with performance tuning
